# Reinforcement Learning for AAPL Stock Trading

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **reinforcement learning (RL) model** for trading **Apple (AAPL) stock** -> (choose another if it looks better) . The RL agent will learn to make decisions—**buy**, **sell**, or **hold**—based on historical price data and other relevant indicators. The objective is to maximize profit while managing risk.

## Objectives

- Prepare and utilize historical AAPL stock data ( or any other asset BTC eg.).
- Implement and compare different RL algorithms (e.g., DQN, PPO, A2C).
- Evaluate the performance of the RL models using key trading metrics.

## Dataset Description

We will use **historical price data** for AAPL, specifically **OHLCV** (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data. This data can be obtained for free from **Yahoo Finance**. Additionally, we will calculate **technical indicators** like Moving Average (MA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to enrich the dataset. Optionally, **sentiment data** from social media (e.g., X posts) can be included for a more comprehensive analysis.

### Key Dataset Components:
- **OHLCV Data**:
  - **Open**: Price at the start of the trading day.
  - **High**: Highest price during the day.
  - **Low**: Lowest price during the day.
  - **Close**: Price at the end of the day.
  - **Volume**: Number of shares traded.
- **Technical Indicators**:
  - **Moving Average (MA)**: Average price over a period (e.g., 50 days). Helps identify trends.
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures if the stock is overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30).
- **Sentiment Data (Optional)**: Positive or negative sentiment from social media posts about AAPL.

## Minimal modelisation 

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of AI where an **agent** learns by interacting with an **environment**, receiving **rewards** for good actions and penalties for bad ones. In this project:

- **Agent**: The RL model that decides whether to buy, sell, or hold AAPL stock.
- **Environment**: A simulation of the stock market using historical AAPL data.
- **State**: The current market condition, represented by features like price, MA, RSI, etc.
- **Action**: The decision to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold**.
- **Reward**: The profit or loss from the action (e.g., +$5 for a good trade, -$3 for a bad one).
- **Policy**: The strategy the agent learns to maximize rewards over time.

The agent learns through trial and error, improving its decisions based on past experiences.

## Steps to Build the RL Trading Model

Follow these steps to build and test the RL trading model for AAPL:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Download historical OHLCV data for AAPL from **Yahoo Finance**.
- Use the `yfinance` library in Python to fetch the data.
  ```python
  import yfinance as yf
  data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2010-01-01", end="2025-01-01")
  ```

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Clean the data (handle missing values, if any).
- Calculate technical indicators:
  - **50-day Moving Average (MA50)**: `data["MA50"] = data["Close"].rolling(50).mean()`
  - **14-day RSI**: Use `pandas-ta` library.
    ```python
    import pandas_ta as ta
    data["RSI"] = ta.rsi(data["Close"], length=14)
    ```
- (Optional) Add sentiment data using tools like **VADER** for social media sentiment analysis.

### 3. **Environment Setup**
- Use **FinRL**, a Python library designed for RL in finance, to create a trading environment.
- The environment will simulate trading based on historical data, allowing the agent to practice.
- Example setup:
  ```python
  from finrl import FinRL
  env = FinRL(data)  # Load your preprocessed data
  ```

### 4. **Algorithm Selection**
- Choose RL algorithms to test:
  - **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Good for stable markets.
  - **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Reliable for volatile markets.
  - **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**: Faster alternative to PPO.
- Use **Stable-Baselines3** for easy implementation of these algorithms.

### 5. **Model Training**
- Train each algorithm on the historical data (e.g., 2010–2020).
- Use a consistent number of training steps (e.g., 100,000) for fair comparison.
- Example:
  ```python
  from stable_baselines3 import DQN, PPO, A2C
  models = {
      "DQN": DQN("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1),
      "PPO": PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1),
      "A2C": A2C("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
  }
  for name, model in models.items():
      model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
  ```

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- Test each trained model on unseen data (e.g., 2021–2025).
- Evaluate performance using key metrics (see below).
- Example:
  ```python
  results = {}
  for name, model in models.items():
      results[name] = env.test(model)
  ```

### 7. **Comparison and Analysis**
- Compare the performance of each algorithm based on evaluation metrics.
- Analyze which algorithm performs best and why (e.g., DQN might be better for stable trends, PPO for volatility).

## Algorithms to Test

We will test the following RL algorithms, each with its own strengths:

### 1. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
- **What It Does**: Learns the value of each action (buy, sell, hold) in different market conditions.
- **Good For**: Stable markets with clear patterns.
- **Pros**: Simple and effective for discrete actions.
- **Cons**: May struggle with very noisy or volatile markets.

### 2. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **What It Does**: Learns a policy (trading strategy) and improves it cautiously.
- **Good For**: Volatile markets or complex data.
- **Pros**: Stable and reliable, handles complexity well.
- **Cons**: Slower to train than DQN.

### 3. **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**
- **What It Does**: Combines policy learning with value estimation for efficient training.
- **Good For**: Moderate complexity trading tasks.
- **Pros**: Faster than PPO in some cases.
- **Cons**: Less stable, may require tuning.

**Note**: For simplicity, we will use a **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)** as the learning architecture for all algorithms. This is the default in Stable-Baselines3 but feel free to test other architectures.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of each RL model, use the following metrics:

- **Total Profit**: The cumulative profit from trading actions.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures profit adjusted for risk (higher is better).
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest loss from a peak to a trough (lower is better).
- **Win Rate**: The percentage of trades that resulted in profit.

These metrics will help you compare the algorithms fairly and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we should achieve the following:

- A functional RL trading model for AAPL stock.
- Insights into how different RL algorithms perform in trading scenarios.
- An understanding of the challenges and limitations of applying RL to financial markets.
- Identification of the most promising algorithm for further development or real-world testing.
